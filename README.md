In this Codecademy project, I developed a system that makes it easier to organize patient data. 

I created a class that does the following:
Takes in patient parameters regarding their personal information, contains methods that allow users to update their information, gives patients insight into their potential medical fees.
Overall, this code demonstrates the use of a class to represent patients and manage their information and insurance costs through various methods.
